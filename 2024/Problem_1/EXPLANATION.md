### **Explanation of the `Feeder` Class**
The `Feeder` class simulates a **bird feeder** where birds come daily to eat, and occasionally, a bear might visit and empty the feeder. 

---

## **1. Instance Variable**
```java
private int currentFood;
```
- **`currentFood`** stores the current amount of food (in grams) in the feeder.
- This variable **never goes below 0**.

---

## **2. Constructor**
```java
public Feeder(int initialFood) {
    this.currentFood = Math.max(0, initialFood); // Ensure non-negative value
}
```
- Takes an `initialFood` parameter (grams of food).
- **Ensures** that food is not negative using `Math.max(0, initialFood)`.

---

## **3. `simulateOneDay(int numBirds)`**
Simulates a single day where **birds or a bear** might visit.

### **How it works:**
1. **5% chance (Bear visits üêª)**  
   - The bear empties the feeder (`currentFood = 0`).
2. **95% chance (Birds visit üê¶)**  
   - Each bird eats **randomly between 10-50 grams**.
   - The total food needed is:  
     ```java
     totalFoodNeeded = numBirds * gramsPerBird;
     ```
   - If there is **enough food**, it is subtracted.  
   - If not, the birds eat whatever is left (`currentFood = 0`).

---

## **4. `simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)`**
Runs the simulation for **multiple days**.

### **How it works:**
1. **Loops for `numDays` times**, or **until the feeder is empty**.
2. **Before each day starts, it checks if food is available**.  
   - If food is `0`, the simulation stops.
3. **Simulates one day** using `simulateOneDay(numBirds)`.
4. If food is eaten (`currentFood < foodBeforeDay`), it counts the day as a "successful feeding day."
5. **Returns the total number of days birds or a bear found food.**

---

## **5. `getCurrentFood()`**
```java
public int getCurrentFood() {
    return currentFood;
}
```
- Returns the **current amount of food** in the feeder.

---

## **6. `addFood(int amount)`**
```java
public void addFood(int amount) {
    if (amount > 0) {
        currentFood += amount;
    }
}
```
- Allows **adding more food** to the feeder.
- Prevents adding negative amounts.

### **Summary**
| Method | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `Feeder(int initialFood)` | Initializes the feeder with a non-negative amount of food. |
| `simulateOneDay(int numBirds)` | Simulates a day: birds eat food or a bear empties the feeder. |
| `simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)` | Runs the simulation for multiple days, stopping when food runs out. |
| `getCurrentFood()` | Returns the current food amount. |
| `addFood(int amount)` | Adds food to the feeder (if `amount > 0`). |

### **Example Usage**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Feeder feeder = new Feeder(500); // Start with 500 grams of food
        
        feeder.simulateOneDay(5); // Simulate one day with 5 birds
        System.out.println("Food left: " + feeder.getCurrentFood()); 
        
        int daysFed = feeder.simulateManyDays(5, 10); // Simulate for up to 10 days
        System.out.println("Days with food: " + daysFed);
        
        feeder.addFood(200); // Add 200 grams of food
        System.out.println("New food amount: " + feeder.getCurrentFood());
    }
}
```
